agenda of what the meeting will cover
things that were unfinished business from last meeting
things that are new business that need to be talked about
any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
